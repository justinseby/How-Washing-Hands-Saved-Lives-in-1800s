# How-Washing-Hands-Saved-Lives-in-1800s

This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at 
the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because 
he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have 
given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General 
Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it 
because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors 
delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover 
the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis 
realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.

This ML project is based on Semmelweis data. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals.

The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good. One reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s.  If he would have had access to the analysis we've just put together he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands. This project is focus on the effect of handwashing With the data loaded we can now look at the proportion of deaths over time.
